# System Files 

The following sections cover each python file.

Note: Each city folder contains a **config.py file** that is essential for managing data sources. This file defines path variables for various datasets, such as postcode CSVs, bus routes, and more.

All Python scripts reference this configuration file to determine which data to process, so when adding new cities to the project please follow the structure and variable names when building a new config file. 

The config.py file found in data/dundee should be the template reference for creating new city config files.
