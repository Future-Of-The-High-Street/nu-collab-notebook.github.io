# Section 6 - Business Integration

### Cell 18
This cell displays businesses with nearby bus stops.

You can:
- Select business categories from the drop-down list  
- Choose additional data to be shown when clicking a business marker  
  *(Multiple popup data selections are possible using **CTRL** or **SHIFT**)*

There is also a range slider for adjusting a meter distance radius.  
This determines which bus stops fall within a radius around each business.

---

### Draw Options
There are two draw modes to help visualise nearby bus stops more clearly:

1. **Circles**  
   Displays a circle radius around each business (size based on your selected radius)
2. **Lines**  
   Draws direct lines from each business to the nearby bus stops  
   *(Click a line to see the distance)*
