# Section 2 - Postcode Section

### Cell 3:  
This section deals with displaying postcodes on the map.  
You can select if you want to show postcodes within the whole city boundary or certain areas like city centre boundaries or even shopping districts.

To run this cell simply click the play button as before, select which boundary you would like to see postcodes inside, and then click **Accept** when you are ready to see them.  

*Keep in mind: the more postcodes we are expecting to see, the longer it will take to load.*
