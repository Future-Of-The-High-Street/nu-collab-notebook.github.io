# Section 3 - Affluence HeatMap

### Cell 4  
This section deals with displaying heatmaps of affluences and household densities for each postcode.

After running it:  
1. Select any boundaries you want to include from the drop-down list.  
2. Click the check box to confirm you want to have them (this is just for visualising - it is not important).  
3. Select the heatmap type with the next drop-down below the check box and click **Apply**.  

You should see the heatmap displayed on the map with a legend explaining the colours on the bottom left corner.
