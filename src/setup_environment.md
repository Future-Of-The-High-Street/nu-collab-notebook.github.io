# Section 1 - Set Up Environment

This first section gets everything ready behind the scenes so that the notebook works and loads the correct city.  

**This part always needs to be done when either starting the notebook or restarting it otherwise the later parts wont work.**

## Running the First Cell

### Cell 1

- First click the little play button on the left of the cell.  
- Wait a bit for the white area to appear with a drop-down box for selecting cities.  
- Click that box and select the city you want.

Thats it! The chosen city will now be set up to use for the rest of the notebook.

### Cell 2
As it is always good to confirm things, let's check if we have actually loaded up the city we wanted.

Since the next cell (Cell 2) displays the city and its boundaries, we can run it to test if our chosen city has been loaded properly like this:

> Your browser does not support the video tag.
></video>  
>
>*Figure 11: Running Cell 2 to confirm city selection.*


Since Cell 2 is showing Dundee I now know the notebook is all set up and working for that city!

This may seem complicated for now but don't worry - if you have gotten the correct city to load up on the map like in the above video, then be relieved to know the rest of the notebook works the same way!
